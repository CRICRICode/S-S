# Software Engineering Project - University Exam
# SerpentiEScale

## Overview

This repository contains a project developed as part of a bachelor's degree exam in Computer Engineering. The main objective of the project was to apply various **design patterns** in software design and implementation.

## Design Patterns Used

The project demonstrates the following design patterns:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer**: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object changes state and all its dependents are notified.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional functionality to objects dynamically.
- **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime based on the context.

## Features

- Demonstration of multiple design patterns.
- Modular and extensible code.
- Designed with best practices in software engineering in mind.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   > git clone https://github.com/CRICRICode/S-S.git cd S-S

2. **Compile and Run**:
   - Ensure you have Java (version 8 or higher) installed.
   - Compile the code using your favorite IDE or command line.

   For command line:
   > javac src/*.java java src.Main

## Usage

This project is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating the practical application of different design patterns. The implementation details and how each pattern is used can be explored in the source code files located in the `src` folder.
